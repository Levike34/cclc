Cross-Chain NFT swap and management specialized for in-game, simultaneous multi-blockchain connections.

# VRMETA Native Payment SDK
One of VRMETA's most important native applications will be the decentralized ability to buy VRMETA with credit cards or third party
payment apps anywhere in the world, then bridge to any network.  This is to eliminate the need to go through exchanges to get on-chain; 
users can now get on-chain directly.
