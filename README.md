# CURRENCY 
VRMETA
Total Supply Cap: 500,000,000
Initial circulating supply: 50,000,000 for airdrops, investments, development.

# VRMETA Mining
Timestake Pallet - Players earn VRMETA and secure the network by mining VRMETA at a mathematical rate based on individual staking amounts,
time played, and overall total supply as follows (subject to change): 

REWARD = (Time played / 3_600 ) x (total individual staked / total circulating supply)

Mining only occurs while playing~

# Multi-chain NFTs
Cross-Chain NFT swap and management specialized for in-game, simultaneous multi-blockchain connections.
NFTs will be tradable in a multichain atmosphere by allocating NFTs and NFT types to a swapping pool, similar to Uniswap's ERC20 token pools.
NFTs and game-assets will be easily transportable across blockchains using our specialized gameserver-VRMETA chain architecture.<br></br>

# VRMETA Native Payment SDK
One of VRMETA's most important native applications will be the decentralized ability to buy VRMETA with credit cards or third party
payment apps anywhere in the world, then bridge to any network.  This is to eliminate the need to go through exchanges to get on-chain; 
users can now get on-chain directly.
